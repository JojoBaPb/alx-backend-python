# Python Decorators – Database Operations

This project focuses on mastering Python decorators and applying them to real-world database operations. The tasks demonstrate how to enhance code readability, maintainability, and efficiency by abstracting repetitive logic into reusable decorators.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement Python decorators.
- Automate database connection handling.
- Log SQL queries for better observability.
- Manage transactions using decorators.
- Retry failed database queries.
- Cache query results to reduce redundant operations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite3

## 📁 Project Structure

Each task is implemented in a separate file within the `python-decorators-0x01` directory:

- `0-log_queries.py`: Logs SQL queries.
- `1-with_db_connection.py`: Handles DB connections.
- `2-transactional.py`: Manages transactions.
- `3-retry_on_failure.py`: Retries failed operations.
- `4-cache_query.py`: Caches SQL query results.
